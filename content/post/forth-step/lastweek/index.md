#  Last week task had me to add three section to the site (skills, experience, accomplishments)

# Overview

As i mentioned earlier the site now have three new sections which made the site more personalise. Have a bigger view of who i am.

# Completing The Task

The steps to make these changes are very simple. Every section in the site have page in markdown associated to it in the home directory. For example when i wished to add my skills.

I headed to content/home/skills.md modified the content and rebuilt the site. Same steps for the other two sections

That's it for the last week task.

Thanks.
