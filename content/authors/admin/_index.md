I  am passionate about computers and technology. My primary focus is on the security field. I can't see myself working in another field and I am fully committed to regularly self improve myself. I find thatdiscipline is one of my strong sides.

I started 3 years ago by learning about website technologies and languages.After that, I started to read and learn about everything related to technology and computers. from computer components to operating systems to programming languages to AI. hen is started learning networking.  networking protocols and modules.I picked security and hacking since it is the most fun side of any technology.

I started to learn about a buffer overflow, privilege escalating, some known CVEs, and a lot of tools. I practiced on vulnerable machines and rooted them. The rush and excitement when rooting a machine kept me going. then I got into binary exploitation and reverse engineering but here is where I  decide to change to web app security stuff.

I started with OWSAP top 10 and did a lot of practice on vulnerable machines and played CTF challenges. Then I started to get into the  infosec community, where everyone shared their knowledge and their write-ups about findings. That's when I knew this is where I want to be.
