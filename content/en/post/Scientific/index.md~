# Overview

a scientific programming language is one that is designed and optimized for the use of mathematical formula and matrices. Such languages are characterized not only by the availability of libraries performing mathematical or scientific functions, but by the syntax of the language itself. For example, neither C++ nor Python have built-in matrix types or functions for matrix arithmetic (addition, multiplication etc); instead, this functionality is made available through standard libraries.

## Top scientific programming languages

1. Python

Python is a general purpose popular programming language. Learning Python opens up doors not only in data science, but also in web and software development.

Python is an open source object-oriented programming language, grouping data and functions together for flexibility and composability. In data science, it's commonly for data processing, implementing data analytics algorithms, and training machine learning and deep learning algorithms. Python supports multiple data structures and uses a plain English syntax, making it a great language for beginner programmers
